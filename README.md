The printf project is a collaboration project by Maxwell Nmesoma Jennifer and Victor David, students of the ALX Software Engineering Programme, in which a function named _printf imitates the actual printf command located in the stdio.h library. The fuction printf is a combination of some basic C programming features that systematically prints and convert string functions.
