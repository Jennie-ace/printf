The printf project is a collaboration project by Maxwell Nmesoma Jennifer and Victor David, students of the ALX Software Engineering Programme, in which a function named _printf imitates the actual printf command located in the stdio.h library. It contains some of the basic features and functions found in the manual 3 of printf.
